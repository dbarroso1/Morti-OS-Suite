                <i>(Relationship Trained Communications)</i>
                <p>
                    The RTC Module is used by Morti as its main method of communication with the user. The goal of the RTC Module is to process
                    user inputs, and define the context of said input, while calculating an emotional value (1-10) to the
                    expression given.

                <i>(Emotional Quantifyer Engine)</i>
                <p>
                    Morti is planned to have a vast array of emotional responses. Although the amount of emotional responses are limited to Six
                    Primary Emotions, Morti can calculate multiple emotions to get acheive Secondary Emotional responses.
                    (See Image Below) Each word in the Input Phrase is seperated from the whole, given a corresponding Emotional
                    Weight, and is then its averaged out to find the phrases Emotional Score.

                <i>(Live Simulation Interface)</i>
                <p>
                    The LS Module is where Morti exsists as a simulated avatar in a virtual world. This Module is how the user will mainly interact
                    with Morti via a GUI. All modules will combine here to give a full live experience. Using an XOR Artificial
                    Neural Network and Unity, Morti will need to train and learn about his environment so that he can survive.
