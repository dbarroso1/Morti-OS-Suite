# Morti-OS (RTC) Relationship Trained Communications

## Fixes

- Needs to be updated for Tensorflow 1.4+
- Needs Morti.py to be seperated into individual Files:
    ```Python
    param_config.py     # Configuration file
    morti_bot.py        # Chatbot
    seq2seq.py          # Seq2Seq Variable Engine
    trainer.py          # Seq2Seq Model Trianer
    ```
- Add a way to live train Seq2Seq Model
