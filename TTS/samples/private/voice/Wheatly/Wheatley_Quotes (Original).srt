5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
have you know 10,000 other test subjects
begging me to help them escape you know

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,370
it's not like this place is about to
explode

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,969
all right look okay I'll be honest
you're the last test subject left and if

8
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,329
you don't help me we're both gonna die
all right if you want to say it there

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,200

looking good actually are you okay are

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,739
you don't answer that I'm actually sure
you're fine there's plenty of time for

12
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,580
you to recover just take it slow
stay calm stay calm prepare it's always

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,720
saying prepare it's all fine alright
don't move I'm gonna get us out of here

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,880
oh you might want to hang on to
something

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,520
word of advice up to you you're right
down there can you hear me hello most

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,259
test subjects do experience some
cognitive deterioration after a few

17
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,850
months in suspension now you've been
under for quite a lot longer and it's

18
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,100
not out of the question that you might
have a very minor case of serious brain

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,280
damage but don't be alarmed
alright although if you do if you do

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
feel alarm try to hold onto that feeling
because that is the proper reaction to

21
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,659
being told that you've got brain damage
do you understand what I'm saying that's

22
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,560
all what does any of this make any sense
just tell me just say yes okay what

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,770
you're doing there is jumping you just
you just jumped but never mind

24
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,360
say Apple Apple simple word Apple just
say Apple classic very simple a double

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,070
ple just say Apple easy word isn't it
Apple how would you use it in a sentence

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,240
mmm this apples crunchy you might say
and I'm not even asking you for the

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,330
whole sentence just the word Apple okay
you know what that's close enough just

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,840
hold tight okay look I wasn't gonna
mention this to you but I'm in pretty

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,690
hot water
how you doing down there he's still

30
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,340
holding on the reserve power ran out so
of course the whole relaxation center

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,990
stops waking up the bloody test subjects
hold on this is a bit tricky and of

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,370
course nobody tells me anything know
what you tell me anything why should I

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,300
be kept informed you know about the life
functions of the 10000 bloody test

34
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,740
subjects I'm supposed to be in charge of
all rights cloaks can you see I'm not

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,870
gonna make it through have I got enough
space just just go get through here okay

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,710
I just got concentrate and whose fault
do you think it's gonna be when the

37
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,120
management comes down here and finds
10000 flippin vegetables all right see

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,570
now I hate that one I hate that one okay
listen we should get our stories

39
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,740
straight all right if anyone asks and no
one's gonna ask don't worry but if

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,360
anyone asks tell them as far as you know
the last time you checked everyone

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,570
looked pretty much alive all right not
dead okay almost there on the other side
of that wall is one of the old testing

42
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,570
tracks there's a piece of equipment in
there that we're gonna need to get out

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,620
of here I think this is a docking
station get ready

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,170
good news that is not a docking station
so there's one mystery solved I'm going
to attempt a manual override on this

45
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,260
wall could get a bit technical hold on
almost there

46
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,260
remember you're looking for a gun that
makes holes not bullet holes but don't

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,200
worry you'll figure out seriously do
hold on this time well there we go now

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,730
I'll be honest you are probably in no
fit state to run this particular type of

49
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,890
cognitive gauntlet but at least you're a
good jumper so you got that got the

50
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,000
jumping on your side just do your best
and I'll meet you up ahead all right off

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,080
you go go on just March on through that
hole yeah it's all right go ahead I know

52
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,440
I know I have painted quite a grim
picture of your chances but if you
simply stand here we will both surely

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,410
die so once again just move along one
small step and everything on you go your

54
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,690
destinations probably not going to come
and meet us here is it so go on that's

55
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,520
the spirit good luck hey you made it
there should be a portal device on that

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,720
podium over there I can't see it though
maybe it fell off don't go

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,750
great look it's all right Nicole just
have a look about now that's right over

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,060
by the podium yeah
if you just okay just stand by the

59
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,770
podium and just look up that's it yeah
that's it yeah oh hello can you see the

60

important you have asked that first um

61
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,330

work on the assumption that you're still

62
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,530
alive and I'm just gonna wait for you up
ahead I'll wait I'll wait one hour then

63
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,720

your dead body I'll bury you all right

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,680

Hey hi I'm up here Oh brilliant you did
find a portal gun of the deal what it

66
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,330
just goes to show people with brain
damage are the real heroes in the end
aren't they at the end of the day brave

67
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,040
pop a portal on that wall behind me

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,370
side of the room just pop a portal right
behind me there and come on through to

69
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,450

do it again pick me up again let's do it
again pick me up again and off we go

114
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,610
look this no rail to tell us where to go
oh this is brilliant you go ever we want

115
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,790
just hold on there where are we going
seriously hey let me just get my

116
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,210
bearings um
just follow the rail actually Oh No yes

117
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,080
he'll stop don't be content whatever you
do no thanks we're good

118
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,960
free sure keep moving keep moving
probable to bring you up to speed on

119
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,680
something right now in order to escape
we're gonna have to go through her
chamber and she will probably kill us if

120
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,380
she's awake if you want to just call it
quits

121
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,180
we could just sit here forever that's an
option option a sit here do nothing

122
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,500
option B go through there and if she's
alive she will most certainly kill us so

123
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,180
if you've got any reservations
whatsoever about this plan now would be

124
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,200
a tremendous time to voice them right
now in case you thought to yourself I've

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,880
missed the window of time to voice no
reservations still open okay I'm gonna

126
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,370
lay my cards on the table I don't want
to do it I don't want to go in there

127
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,240
don't go in to geez off she's off don't
panic over she's off Oh fine oh we go

128
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,630
there she is
what a nasty piece of work she was

129
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,260
honestly like a pop Romania do you know
who ended up her do you know who ended

130
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,339
up taking her down in the end you're
gonna believe this a human I know I know

131
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,160
I wouldn't believe it either
probably this human escaped and nobody's
seen him since the sort of long hunk of

132
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,220
time where absolutely nothing happened
and then there's also scape you know so

133
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,990
that's pretty much the whole story
you're up to speed

134
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,920
don't touch anything okay down these
stairs okay down those stairs please

135
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,610
jump this actually look at it that is
quite that's quite a distance isn't it

136
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,130
okay you know what
go ahead and jump you've got you've got

137
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,270
braces on your legs so you're all set
although no braces on your arms though

138
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,930
so you're gonna have to rely on the old
human strength to keep a grip on the

139
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,160
device and by extension me so do do
really make sure you keep a grip on me

140
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,260
also a note no braces on your spine
either so so don't land on that or your

141
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,500
head no braces there that could that
could split like a melon from this

142
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,370
height so do definitely focus on landing
with your legs great question have you

143
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,089
been working out cuz I'm gonna stairs no
evidence of it you know I'm not I'm not

144
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:52,100
like just a plastic cup we will be
landing with some force so a bit of bit

145
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,080
of grip is using grip classic grip right
let's go jump what's the worst that

146
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,020
could happen
ah I just thought about the worst thing
that could happen that oh I just thought

147
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,630
something even worse better plan a new
plan no imagining of any potential

148
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,139
outcomes whatsoever okay just just jump
just jump into the into the abyss

149
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:16,009
and see what happens oh I still there is
still in my head Oh still held still

150
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,459
being held you think that's a great job
you've applied the grip we're all fine
that's tremendous yeah I just sorry I

151
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,160
just looked down I do not recommend it
ah I've just done it again I just now

152
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,759
realize that I used to rely on my
management rail to not fall into

153
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,350
bottomless pits in a way you're my rail
now and you can't fall into a bottomless

154
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,829
pit and her rambling now out of fear but
here's the point don't get too close to
the edge this is the main breaker room

155
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,819
let's go in look for a switch that says
escape pod all right don't touch

156
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,369
anything else no issues anything else
don't touch anything else

157
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,489
don't even look anything else just well
obviously gonna look at everything else

158
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,309
to find the escape pod but as soon as
you look this I mean it doesn't say
escape pod look at something else look

159
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,759
at the next thing alright but don't
touch anything else or look anything

160
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,799
well look at other things but don't you
understand

161
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,059
can you see anywhere I can't see
anywhere tell you what plug me in and

162
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,339
I'll turn the lights on let there be
light

163
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:11,389
that's God is quoting God oh look at
that it's turning ominous but probably

164
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:16,790
fine long as it doesn't start in there
moving up now escape by ski pod it's

165
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,489
moving up okay don't worry don't worry
I've got it I've got it I've got it

166
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,419
this should slow it down no makes it go
faster oh okay don't panic

167
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:28,910
all right stop panicking I can I can
still stop this oh there's a there's a

168
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,720
password okay it's fine I'll just I'll
just hack it not a problem

169
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:44,810
ay ay ay ay ay ay
okay ay ay ay ay ay si no wait did I do
beat your pen start writing these down

170
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,510
I'd okay okay okay listen all right new
plan act natural natural we've done

171
00:12:50,510 --> 00:13:02,750
nothing wrong hello you know her you did
what okay what happened right I was just

172
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,630
lying there
you thought I was done bird right

173
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,630
couldn't believe it either
and then the bird I found some bird eggs

174
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,170
up here just drops me to the door
mechanism shut it right down like ah

175
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:18,440
bird bird bird bird okay that's probably
the bird in it that laid the eggs livid

176
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,560
okay look the point is we're gonna break
out of here alright very soon I promise
I promise I just have to figure out how

177
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,920
to break us out of here here she comes
keep tape just keep testing remember you
never saw me never saw me hey how's it

178
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,610
going I talked my way onto the old
nanobot work crew rebuilding this shelf

179
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,910
they are really small I know Jerry no
I'm on a break mate Wow

180
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,990
just hang in there for five more T's
what Jerry you can't fire me for that

181
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,190
yes Jerry
or maybe you're prejudiced work site

182
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,600
should have accommodated a nanobot of my
size thanks for the hate crime Jer see

183
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,529
you in court mate anyway look just hang
in there for five more chambers hey

184
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:01,279
buddy
I'm speaking in an accent that is beyond

185
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,550
her range of hearing I know I'm early
but we have to go right now what

186
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,160
casually toward my position and we'll go
shut her down but I don't need to do the

187
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,900
voice run run come on come on come on
keep moving just keep moving run for

188
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,750
goodness sake
Coco Coco Ron come on I'm closing the

189
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,410
doors okay quick recap we are escaping
all right that's what's happening now

190
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,630
we're escaping so you're doing great
just keep running

191
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,990
quick worried about the future plans
that I've got in store we're gonna shut

192
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,649
down her turret production-line all
right turn offer a neurotoxin and then

193
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:38,089
confront her again though for the moment
right Oh what come how super does she

194
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,040
think we are oh come on come on yeah we
have to get you out of there can you can
you get out what's going on in there

195
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,470
try to make your way back out here I
hear it gunfire it's a bit like this but

196
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,040
I look out for gunfire probably doesn't
help at this point but I have at least
tried you're okay

197
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,050
great come on turrets there's the exit
we're almost out of here she's bringing

198
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:04,290
the whole place down hurry hurry this
way hurry this way get in the lift get

199
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,380
in the lift we've made it we made it we
made it we made it I'll meet you on the

200
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,430
other side ah brilliant you made it
through well then okay follow me we've

201
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,710
still got work to do
at least she can't touch us back here

202
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:21,120
what's happening hmm okay okay don't
move okay all right so I've got an idea

203
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:29,809
but it is bloody dangerous here we go
ah ah God they told me that if I ever

204
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,980
turn this flashlight on I would die they
told me that about everything I mean I

205
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,350
don't even know why they bother giving
me this stuff if they didn't want me to

206
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:42,050
use it it's pointless mad Oh start down
here isn't it they say that the old
caretaker of this place went absolutely

207
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,079
crazy chopped up his entire staff of
robots all of them robots they say at

208
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:57,050
night you can still hear the screams of
their replicas all of them functionally

209
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,160
indistinguishable from the originals no
memory of the incident nobody knows what

210
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,089
they're screaming about absolutely
terrifying though obviously not

211
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,800
paranormal in any meaningful way Oh
careful now try to jump across let's
keep moving the factory entrance must be

212
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,749
around here somewhere careful careful
wait careful let me light this jump for

213
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:18,439
you okay this looks dangerous I'll hold
the light steady Oh nicely done quick
this way here's an interesting story you

214
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,459
might like this
I almost got a job down here in

215
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:27,709
manufacturing but guess who the foreman
went with only an exact duplicate of

216
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:32,329
himself nepotism ended up giving me the
worst possible job tending to all the

217
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:38,779
smelly humans the the sorry that's no I
would say smelly just just attending to

218
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,899
the humans sorry about that I just
that's just slip taint of being

219
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:46,579
sensitive the smelly humans okay wait
let me like this path for you okay we

220
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,730
have to split up here for a moment
portal up to that passage and I'll see

221
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,670
you on the other side we've got to get
you out of that room can you reach that
wall back there okay there's another

222
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,920
wall over here oh that's how you humans
oh love them just then fading look it's
great and there you folklore wonderfully

223
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,010
colorful
right well I'm gonna take this rail down

224
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,059
the back way see you at the bomb good
luck be careful this is the turret

225
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,559
manufacturing wing just pass this is the
old neurotoxin production facility and

226
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,439
if we find a way to take them both
offline she's gonna be completely

227
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,020
helpless
which is ideal I'm pretty sure we're

228
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,980
going the right way pretty sure the
turret factory should be this way I

229
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,750
think oh just thought another great
thing about humans you invented us which

230
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,299
is great giving us the opportunity to
let you relax while we invented

231
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,850
everything else
could've done any of that without you

232
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,309
classy if you don't mind me saying are
you okay

233
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,110
are you alive down there if you're alive
can you say something jump around so I

234
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,230
know you're okay oh there you are they
are so I'm starting to get worried all

235
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,320
right let's try this again try to make
your way across the machinery let's keep

236
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,440
moving the factory entrance must be
around here somewhere okay this way no

237
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,940
no I'm sure it's this way I'm definitely
sure it's this way mmm okay let's try

238
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,909
this way could you hear that she's
really kicked this place into high gear

239
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,260
no no no no not that way here it is the
turret Factory entrance we made it ah
brilliant you made it through well done

240
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,049
follow me you're gonna love this almost
there there are only the turret control

241
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,770
center thank you very much yeah come on
look out the window it's good go on just

242
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,730
walk up the window okay it's interesting
I think you won't regret it I promise

243
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,820
just glass transparent smooth not gonna
hurt you have a look go on walk up to

244
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,360
the window take a look out see that
scanner right there right it's deciding

245
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,470
which turrets to keep and which to toss
and it's using that master turret there

246
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,429
as a template if we pull out the
template turret it'll shut down the

247
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,630
whole production line right hmm I'm
gonna have to hack the door so that we

248
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,539
can get at it
technical you'll need to turn right
while I do this turn around I'll only be

249
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,260
a second if you would mind God just just
turn right the way around so you're not

250
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,440
looking at me just turn around
could you would you turn around is that

251
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,110
possible would you mind putting your
back towards me so I can see only your
back and not your face done hacked okay

252
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,600
go on just pull that turret out what
that should do it
Oh hasn't done it right let's figure out

253
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,100
how to stop this turret line have you
got any ideas any ideas any ideas no no

254
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,740
me neither
are you are you still thinking or what's

255
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,240
happening tell you what here's a plan
let's just both continue contemplating

256
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,529
in absolute silence oh wait I got it
no I've got it oh I just had one idea

257
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:35,090
which is that I could pretend to her
that I've captured you and give you over

258
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,950
and she'll kill you but then I could go
on living so what's your view on that

259
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,500
there's no turret in it maybe the system
stores a backup image oh no hang on what

260
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,520
if we what if we gave it something else
to scam we could get one of the the crap

261
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,680
turrets we could put it in the scanner
see what happens yeah

262
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,830
go and catch one of the crap turrets and
bring it back wait where are you going
where are you going Oh have you got idea

263
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,050
okay well alright just do your idea and
then come straight back sorry what's
going on over there you know I'm

264
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,760
actually over here still thinking really
hard what what you have there

265
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,880
what are you Oh brilliant is / that's
brilliant

266
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,360
oh no you've got it you've got it yes
put him in there Oh let's see how this
place likes a crap turret it worked

267
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,480
if we're lucky she won't find out all
the turrets are crap until it's too late

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,360
classic okay keep your eye on the turret
line I'm gonna go and hack the door open
okay I'm about to start hacking it's a

269
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,170
little bit more complicated than it
looked from your side it should take

270
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,990
about 10 minutes keep one eye on the
door

271
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,980
these stores actually pretty complicated
you know when I mentioned 10 minutes a

272
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,350
little bit optimistic progress report
still pretty tricky progress report I

273
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,010
haven't really made any inroads I'm
still here I'm still working though i'm

274
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,800
forgotten about yeah oh good news never
mind what's happening your side anything

275
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,630
yeah oh how long's the door been opened
was there any sort of announcement

276
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,110
before I come looking like a buzzer or
an alarm some kind or like a hacker
alert not even you know fair enough the

277
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,840
important thing is it's open but just in
just mention in the future cough or
something all right now she can't use

278
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,180
her turrets so let's go and take care of
that neurotoxin generator as well bring

279
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,260
your daughter to work day that did not
end well and 40 potato batteries

280
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,260
embarrassing I mean I realize they're
children but still you know low-hanging

281
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,880
fruit all that Bailey science really did
baking soda volcano well you know at

282
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,790
least it's not a potato battery I'll
give it that but it's not terrifically
original is it you know I mean exactly

283
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,120
primary research even within the child
sciences I'm guessing this wasn't one of

284
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,840
the scientists children you know I don't
to be snobby but let's be honest it

285
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,440
Scott it's got manual labor written all
over it hasn't it no saying they're not

286
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,690
as good as the professionals you know
they're just they're just a lot dumber

287
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,930
connects growing right up into the
ceiling the whole place is probably

288
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,380
overrun with potatoes at this point
isn't it at least you won't starve them

289
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
I'm pretty sure we're going the right
way just to reassure you don't worry I'm

290
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,360
absolutely guaranteeing you 100% that
it's this way no it's not this way okay
let's try this way ha I knew here we go

291
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,990
in the right way this is the neurotoxin
generator bit bigger than I expected not

292
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,980
going to be able to just you know push
it over

293
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,760
have to apply some cleverness there's
some sort of control room up at the top

294
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,140
so let's go and investigate yeah
there's our handiwork I shouldn't laugh

295
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,030
really they do feel pain of a sort it's
all simulated you know but really enough
for them I suppose

296
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm afraid the doors locked just checked
it no way to hack it as far as I can

297
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,540
tell
mechanism us oh that's a big laser

298
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,880
probably best to ignore it though just
leave it be we don't know where those

299
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,169
panels it's cutting are going could be
somewhere important although does give

300
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:41,770
me an idea what if we stand here and let
the gentle hum of the laser transport us
to a state of absolute relaxation might

301
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:50,080
help us think of a way to open the door
it's not much of a plan if I'm honest

302
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,100
but I'm afraid it's all we got in this
point barring a sudden barrage of speech

303
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:02,880
from your direction improbable at best
all right so silent contemplation it is

304
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,980
ste Rios button sorry sorry silence
speak in the silence let the silence

305
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,340
descend here it comes
100% silence from now by the way if you

306
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,150
come up with any ideas do flag of up
don't feel you've got to stay quiet

307
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,160
because I've said absolute silence so if
you come up with an idea mention it but

308
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:38,710
otherwise absolute silence
starting now let's see what's inside

309
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,700
good news I can use this equipment to
shut down the neurotoxin system it is

310
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,150
however password-protected ah alarm
bells no don't worry

311
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,059
alright not a problem for me you may as
well have a little rest actually while I
work on it okay here we go the hardest

312
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,929
part of any hack is the figuring out how
to start phase that's always tricky but

313
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:05,350
I'll let the games begin
alright what have we got a computer not
a surprise to be expected to be honest

314
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:14,280
check that off the list computer
identified tick there is a box part here

315
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,830
probably up some electronics in there
and a monitor yes

316
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,610
that will be important I imagine I'll
keep my eye on that case something

317
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,110
useful comes up important words like
password identified or something like

318
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,539
that and there's a flat bit not sure
where that is but noted anyone says to

319
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:39,630
me is there a flat bit yes there it is
spinning thing not sure the floor what's

320
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,409
the floor doing oh it's the floor up -
do you know what it's holding everything

321
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:46,620
up holding everything up the floor is
important holding everything up
pens might need those don't see any

322
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,620
though so if we start making a list of
things that aren't here we could be here

323
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,370
all night
you know pens for instance so let's

324
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,760
stick with things we can see not not
stuff it isn't here all right

325
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,409
preparing to interface with the
neurotoxin central control circuit begin

326
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:12,750
a leg of neurotoxin inspector need to
shut this place down for a moment

327
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:19,279
here's my credentials shut yourself down
I have totally legit from the Board of

328
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:27,960
International neurotoxin observers from
the United Arab Emirates hello

329
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,200
nothing it's he's good this one is good
I'm gonna need to break out the expert

330
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:42,840
level hacking maneuvers now all right
you asked for it mate love you have a
look at that gorgeous plumage majestic

331
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,799
look over there will be your log that
lovely bird let that happy off

332
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,710
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this to
see I'm a lovely bird with loving

333
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,269
plumage be a shame to miss it wouldn't
it just for the old neurotoxin

334
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:00,570
neurotoxin will still be here tomorrow
where's that bird it's gonna be gone any

335
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,019
minute it's already got one Talon off
the branch give me God oh it's flowering

336
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,049
its wings I'll tell you what mate I'll
come in there for a minute

337
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:10,019
and cover you so that you could have a
look at this lovely bird all right so

338
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,049
I'll come in I'll deal with all the
neurotoxin staff and then you come out

339
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,929
here and look at this because it is
lovely it is lovely you wallet you wanna

340
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,830
get out fast seriously because all of
this my pleasure sounds are gonna fry it
away 80 seconds that ice not working

341
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,440
there isn't it he's not interested in
bloody Birds you smell the Euro toxin

342
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,669
hold up the neurotoxic levels are going
down so whatever you're doing keep doing

343
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,650
it hold on Sonic's wrong neurotoxin
levels up to 50% no it's tagged sorry my

344
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,880
mistake it seems dying 50% it's good
news carry on it's still going down

345
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,340
still going to keep it up
that did it neurotoxin at 0% yes hold on
huh

346
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,799
the tubes broken we can write it
straight to her I can't hold on come on

347
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,950
come on we have to go hurry get in get
in yeah they should take us right to her

348
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,350
I can't believe I'm finally doing this
whoa I knew this would be fun they told
me it wasn't fun at all they say it's

349
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,309
not fun at all I mean I believed I was a
fool to myself this whale of a time this
place is huge

350
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,070
I'm already seeing the top layer it goes
down from miles all sealed-off years ago

351
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,520
of course we should be getting close oh
I can't wait to see the look on her face

352
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,770
no neurotoxin no turrets she'll never
know what hit her

353
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,159
hold on hold on because I might not have
thought this next part completely

354
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,909
through I'm going the wrong way
get to her I'll find you hello oh that's

355
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,480
me they're talking about oh god I did do
what it says to plug me in no you should

356
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,960
plug that little idiot into the
mainframe yes do do it don't listen to

357
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,580
her do it do it come on stop my heroine
plug me in like me and plug me in I want

358
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,850
to be plugged in please
oh we're so close plug me in Oh what can

359
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,820
we do with me then I know plug me into
the pour please all that port looks

360
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,360
comfy what do you put me on it please
dare it dare to dream

361
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,640
shoot for the stars yes oh yes she is
pull me up pull me out pull me out pull

362
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,390
me up pull me up pull me up pull me up
pull me out pull me out pour me out

363
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,860
leave me in leave me in link up brick go
press it yes do do it I think she's
lying okay don't listen to her alright

364
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,230
it is true that you don't have the
qualifications but you've got something

365
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,650
far more important than their a finger
alright with which to press that button

366
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,419
so that she won't kill us okay oh that's
probably correct but where it's

367
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,409
incorrect is that while I've been
stalling you we just press the button

368
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:29,070
use a moment of confusion I've just
craved to press the button have I let me
just I don't know if I've ever taken the

369
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,200
time to do this but have I ever told you
the qualities that I love most in you in

370
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,590
order number one resolving things love
the way you resolve things particularly
disputes a number one also tied

371
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,890
button-pushing two things I love about
you button pushing and the ability to

372
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,820
resolve things she
disputes first thing I thought about you
when I saw you I thought now there is a

373
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,360
lady who could resolve any button based
disputes if they should arise a diamond
in the rough if you will a bloody

374
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,880
natural a born dispute resolution
advisor in need of a button okay here's

375
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,769
a good idea
you should definitely press that button

376
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:04,220
sorry to interject again but if you do
not push the button the deadly

377
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,940
neurotoxin emitters will come back
online at which point she will most

378
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,440
likely fill you to brimming with
neurotoxin Russia just throwing that out

379
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,580
there for leisurely digestion in your
own time here we go wait what if this
hurts wife this really hurts

380
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,950
I didn't think of that are you are you
just saying that or is it really gonna

381
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,710
hurt you're just saying there aren't you
you're just no you're not you are is

382
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:33,889
gonna hurt isn't it exactly how we did
it I'm in control of the whole facility
now Oh would you look at this

383
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,029
not too bad a giant robot massive it's
not just me right

384
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,510
I am bloody massive aren't I oh right
yeah the escape lift I'll call it now

385
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,450
there we go
lift called look how small you are down

386
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:52,820
there I could barely see you very tiny
and insignificant wait I've just thought

387
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,210
of something how am I gonna get in you
know being bloody massive and everything

388
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,169
wait I know you get into the lift okay
then I'll eject myself out of my new

389
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:04,610
body into the lift just as you passed by
me brilliant it's perfect except for the
glass hitting us when I smash through

390
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,950
the lift that's a bit of a problem also
once I inject myself out of the core the

391
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,419
lift might stop then we'd be trapped in
a lift full of broken glass suspended 50

392
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,330
feet off the ground you know what just
gained the lift and will iron out the
details as we go come on Caine get in

393
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,210
the lift the escape lift just there come
on the one you risked your life to get

394
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:28,130
to so you can escape certain death no
rush um it's the lift just there if the

395
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,700
thing that looks like a lift that's what
you're looking for it is confusing I

396
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,269
know it'll be fine get in let me tell
you I knew it was gonna be cool to be in

397
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:40,519
charge of everything but wow this is
cool and check this out I'm a bloody

398
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,789
genius now it's not some toys for
software they punish only for non

399
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:48,019
correct are you pay in my wallet I don't
even know what I just said but I can

400
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:51,919
find out oh sorry no the lift yes sorry
I keep forgetting this body's amazing

401
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,980
seriously I can't go over how small you
are behind huge

402
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:10,190
actually why do we have to leave right
now do you have any idea how good this

403
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,980
feels I did this tiny little Wheatley
did this oh really

404
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,860
that's what the two of you think is it
well maybe it's time I did something
then and don't think I'm not onto you

405
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:27,230
too lady you know what you are selfish
I've done nothing but sacrifice to

406
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,910
cutters here and what have you
sacrificed nothing zero all you've done

407
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:38,840
is boss me around while now who's the
boss who's the boss ah see that that is
a potato battery it's a toy for children

408
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,710
and now she lives in it
so uh what no not listening not

409
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,340
listening no no you're lying you're
lying I am NOT a moron well how about
now

410
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:06,140
now who's a moron could a moron punch
you into this pit ah good amoral do that

411
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:13,400
oh for God's sake your boxes with legs
it's yet literally your only purpose

412
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,230
walking on two buns how can you not do
the one thing you're designed for warmer

413
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:23,390
warmer boiling hot boy
okay colder colder ice cold your Arctic

414
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,770
that is yep you're very cold very very
very cold look just get on the button oh
that's fun easy oh he's funny because

415
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,870
we've been at this for 12 hours and you
haven't sold either so no why you're

416
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,560
laughing you've got one hour solve it hi
yes

417
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,430
I knew you'd solve it oh hello um true
I'll go true yeah that was easy I'll be

418
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,030
honest I'm I've heard that one before
though sort of cheating ah false

419
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,960
I'll go false hold on I thought I fixed
that they're fixed Hey

420
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,130
it is great seeing you guys again
seriously it turns out I'm a little bit

421
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,080
short on test subjects right now so this
works out perfect and off we go and off
we go

422
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,330
alright get moving move you have no idea
what it's like in this body I have to
test all the time or I get this this

423
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,970
itch you know it must be hard wired into
the sister

424
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,970
or something oh but I tell you when I do
test

425
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:20,210
oh man alive nothing feels better it's
just I got a test so I've got a test so

426
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:26,360
you're gonna test and I'm gonna watch
and everything is gonna be just fine
shall I designed this test myself it's a

427
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:34,190
little bit difficult you'll notice the
motor area there very deadly extremely

428
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,610
dangerous eventually it's not at the
moment but I'm working on it still
working on it impossible as it is to

429
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,390
imagine there actually is a solution
devilishly hidden I'll give you a hint

430
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:50,510
button that's all I'm gonna say one word
button go on come on solve it solve it

431
00:33:50,510 --> 00:34:01,760
solve it commanding voice oh yes oh well
then that's tremendous

432
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,850
yeah you're not done yet are you still
gotta get through the door need to get

433
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,610
through the door there still go still
gonna get through the door please

434
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,780
through that you need to get through
that door there door finish it oh that

435
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,349
felt really good
oh here's an idea since making tests is

436
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:20,960
so difficult why don't you just keep
solving this test same one and I can

437
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,399
just like what you solve it yeah but
that sounds much easier here we go

438
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,389
now do it again go on come on you've
already solved it come on you've already

439
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:33,500
solved it once less than a minute ago
you solve this puzzle do it again please

440
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,220
one minute go let less than one minute
ago you solve this puzzle now you're

441
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:43,358
having problems you just beat this test
literally 20 seconds ago button

442
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:53,570
press the button the button press the
button mmm nothing all right can't blame

443
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,000
me for trying okay new tests new tests
gotta be some tests around here

444
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,320
somewhere oh here we go it's all right
everything's good I just invented some

445
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,400
more tests not entirely not entirely
look at the word test there on the wall

446
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,330
that's brand new oh well done seriously
both of you why do i why don't you two

447
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,740
go on ahead yeah I'll just I'll catch up
with you ah bless your little primate

448
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,570
brain I'm actually the roux with you oh
my technology it's complicated you can't

449
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,760
hurt the big
old God face do you know what I've got

450
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,180
too many of around ear monitors I was
actually thinking earlier today I got I
wish I had fewer monitors that were

451
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,050
working so you're just helping me really
by smashing him okay

452
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,650
to clarify I was being little bit
facetious about that wanting to get rid

453
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,800
of monitors thing they are actually
really quite useful so I do what their

454
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,290
own so if you could just avoid smashing
them yes all right okay this is getting

455
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,349
tiresome I'm surprised you haven't got
something better to do

456
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:52,310
to be honest I know I have but you what
he done you've proven that you could

457
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,490
break screens it's proven well done
factual well done good

458
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,750
aren't you Little Miss clever little
miss smushy smash sorry does it actually

459
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,619
make you feel good doing that cuz you
know it's not impressive no one's

460
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,280
impressed it's just glass isn't it
fragile anyone could baby could smash

461
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,950
one of them it's not impressive you know
what there are test subjects in Africa
who don't even have monitors in their

462
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,560
test chambers alright why do you think
about that before you break any more of

463
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,280
them yeah what is this like a hobby for
you now I mean honestly it's you know

464
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,089
it's crazy I mean I mean you must you've
been running around for hours I'm
surprised you've got the energy the

465
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,349
smash screens willy nilly honestly I
thought I'd have a little lie-down if I

466
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:34,520
were you with an app starting now if I'm
honest ii wonder if you're doing all

467
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,790
this screen breaking on purpose i'm
beginning to actually take it personally

468
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,650
you know the mean like it's like it's
like an insult to me oh there's another

469
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,060
one there's another one they're not
inexpensive but less like to point that

470
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:52,670
out it seems unfair you know smashing
screens you could give them to people if

471
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,900
you're gonna serve smashing them unscrew
them and give them to like a homeless

472
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,230
person or know what a homeless person
would do with but being at my point it

473
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,790
just seems and you can unscrew a minder
they're bolted in but just stop hear it

474
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,720
yeah just wanted to flag up it's not
like I got hordes of replacement

475
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,560
monitors just lying around back here in
the old where I could just wheel out and

476
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,190
bolt back on didn't didn't order in
loads of spare monitors thinking some

477
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,180
crazy woman's gonna go around smashing
them all sorry if that's my fault sorry

478
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,660
I didn't have the for thoughts I think
all she she might go crazy one day just

479
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,530
smash all the monitors he said just get
on with things that sorry I didn't think

480
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,930
of that they're not even your screens to
break it's vandalism is pure vandalism
you wouldn't do that if this was your

481
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,950
ice would you if you were in if I came
read your ice

482
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,470
smashing you
tell eat a bit you'd be furious and

483
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:46,700
rightly so unbelievable yeah made this
test myself all smaller tests that I

484
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,579
found lying around jammed him altogether
buttons got funnels bottomless pits are

485
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:55,880
involved sky little it's got it all
absolute dynamite alright okay this is

486
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,759
taking too long okay I'll just tell you
how to solve the test okay see that

487
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:09,829
button over there alright never mind
never mind solve it yourself you're on

488
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:18,349
your own
oh yes well dad don't start yet don't

489
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:21,680
start yet you're not gonna believe this
I find a sealed-off wing hundreds
hundreds of perfectly good test chambers

490
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:27,230
just sitting there filled with skeletons
shut them out good as new

491
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:33,140
and there we go be honest you can't even
tell can you seamless oh here we go

492
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,660
here it comes Oh
disappointed alright so that last test

493
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,549
was seriously disappointing apparently
being civil isn't motivating you so

494
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:49,190
let's well let's try her way alright
fratty adopted fatty fatty fatty no

495
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:55,190
parents what what what's wrong with
being adopted aunt well um lack of

496
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:02,420
parents number one so and also nothing
but some of my best friends actually are

497
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:11,299
orphans but just do the test just do the
test it's not enough if I'm such a moron

498
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:16,970
why can't you solve a simple test oh
sorry sorry sorry I hope that isn't but

499
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,239
they didn't disturb you too much then it
was the sound of books pages being

500
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:26,329
turned sighs just what I was doing just
reading books so not immoral anyway just

501
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,230
finish the last one just no the hardest
one Machiavelli do not know what all the

502
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,349
fuss was about understood it perfectly
have you read that one yeah don't it

503
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:38,239
well on the test wish there was more
books who are there's no nothing

504
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,630
there's nothing don't mind me just
moving the old test chamber in a bit

505
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,690
closer to me a default maybe proximity
to the test solving might give us

506
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,230
stronger results what was that hope so I
could have swore you said something

507
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,500
makes me that time oh you assault you
assault sorry nevermind Carol my fault

508
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,400
are you are you absolutely sure you're
solving these correctly I mean yes you

509
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,270
solved it but I'm wondering if maybe
there's a number of ways to solve them

510
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,490
and you pick in all the worst ways no no
that was the solution what my missing

511
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,980
calibrate wave I'm gonna tape you
solving these and then watch ten at once

512
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,720
get a more sort of concentrated burst of
science on a related note I am going to

513
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,020
need you to solve these ten times as
fast anyway just give me a wave would

514
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,300
you before you solve this one all right
I don't want to spoil the ending for

515
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,540
when I watch it later
ow you just solved it in you I told you

516
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:32,060
to tell to tell me before why are you
making this so hard for me was was

517
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,780
self-destructing already fixed
programmed in one last tremor for all

518
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,170
time sake too I'm one or two more
tremors in there just for fun I'll an

519
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,080
keep his job I'm not a monster
ignore what he's saying then just keep

520
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,840
on testing all right still nothing let's
keep moving sorry about the lift it's

521
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,270
out of service
cuz it melted might as well you know

522
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,710
give you the tour to your left
you'll see some lights of some kind

523
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,740
don't what they do but very science-y
anyway and to your right something huge
hurtling to what god rather that's not

524
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,520
supposed to be there are you all right
back there

525
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,210
here I'll turn the beam off for that ah
I didn't why I thought that would help

526
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:13,460
but you're alive
great yeah just getting a test ready for

527
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,380
you obviously who else would I be doing
it for no one so let's see here exit

528
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,330
exit exit there is no exit not from I'll
just I'll make an exit before your test

529
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,470
there Bing good perfect on you go I'll
be honest after you told me to turn that

530
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,990
beam off I thought I had lost you went
poking around for other test subjects no

531
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,130
luck there everyone's still dead oh I
did find something though reminds me

532
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,180
I've got a big surprise for you too
seriously
look forward to it you two are gonna

533
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:51,619
love this big surprise in fact you might
say you're going to love it to death I'm

534
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:56,210
gonna love it until you did until it
kills you till you're dead all right I

535
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,990
don't know whether you're uh you're
picking up on what I'm saying there but
sorry sorry my fault butterfingers

536
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:14,390
carry on only three more chambers to you
big surprise siren oh we solved it good

537
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,730
good one good for you I'll bet you're
both dying to know what your big

538
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:26,000
surprise is well only two more chambers
surprise we're doing it now you've

539
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
probably figured it out by now but I
don't need you anymore

540
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,820
I found two little robots back here
built specifically for testing hello

541
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,090
this is the part where I kill you had a
bit of a brainwave

542
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,810
there I was smashing some steel plates
together and I thought to myself yeah

543
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,780
he's deadly
boss missing what's missing and I

544
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,710
thought lots of sharp bits welded onto
the flat bits it's still a work in

545
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,200
progress
don't judge me yet but you know

546
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,550
eventually I'd like to get them to sort
of shoot fire at you moments before

547
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,410
crushing you
that's the so that's where I'm aiming
for but you know small steps oh and

548
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,310
don't bother trying to portal out of
here because it's impossible okay I've

549
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,890
thought of everything
what you're wrong

550
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:11,990
really and do what exactly
no no stand right here it's that start

551
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,780
machine start machine it's not the
machine where'd you go come back come

552
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,010
back oh you came back I didn't oh I
didn't plan for this

553
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:25,310
uh can't reset the death trap um Oh
could you just jump into that pit would
you just jump into that pit for me would

554
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:32,300
you just jump into that pit there that
deadly pit you saying to yourself why

555
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,170
should I jump in the pit I'll tell you
why guess who's down there your parents

556
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,010
you're not adopted after all it's your
natural parents down there in the pit

557
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,480
should have mentioned it before but I
didn't so jump on down and reunite with

558
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,250
mommy and daddy oh I see what's also
down there to your parents and there's

559
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,700

562
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:09,200
very trendy designer jumped from France
down there which is at least exactly
your size and if it's a bit baggy was

563
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,330
that we got Taylor down there as well

who's to say I'm not sure at this stage
but a lot of good-looking fellas down

567
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:39,400
there and a boy band as well that
haven't seen a woman in years and

568
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,490
they're not picking at all they don't
care if you've got a bit of brain damage
if you've been running around if you've

569
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:52,180
been sweating and farm a pony farm and
uh-oh
just jump down would ya oh good I didn't

570
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,299
think that was gonna work no seriously
do come back please come back please

571
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:04,119
okay look I've decided I'm not gonna
kill you okay if you come back oh just

572
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,910
thinking back to the old times the old
days when we were friends good old
friends not enemies and I would say

573
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,180
something like come back and you'd be
like yeah no problem and you'd come back
what happened to those days can't help

574
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,940
but notice that you're not coming back
which is disappointing oh I've got an

575
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:24,670
idea yes yes shave your face I got fine
let the games begin

576
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:30,369
hold on hold on hold on I'm almost there
ah don't mind me continue escaping that

577
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,250
death trap
are they killing you they are killing

578
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:40,029
you aren't they silently killing you
probably try to guess perhaps the

579
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:46,619
turrets have found a way to use graz
that would explain the extremely quiet

580
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:51,460
killing that I'm hearing if you're dying
but not dead

581
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,369
stomp once if you're dead just obviously
no stomps and two stomps if you're not

582
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:00,819
dead alright so let me run through it
again if you're dying but not dead stop

583
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:04,750
just once if you're dead obviously you
won't be stomping and if you're not dead

584
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:08,980
give me a couple of stops two stomps you
know I would tell you if I was dead

585
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,559
alright that is common courtesy mark of
a civil society so just just let me know

586
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:23,589
okay I'm figuring this probably long
enough are you dead yet how about now ah
was that your bullet-riddled body flying

587
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,599
out the room it what oh those were the
crap turrets weren't they

588
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,090
yeah well no matter because I'm still
holding

589
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:38,030
all the cards and guess what they're all
full houses never actually played cards

590
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:42,820
meaning to learn anyway new turrets not
defective ASA fours the best hand

591
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:48,470
unbeatable
I would imagine oh I see clever very
clever and foolish no way act you're at

592
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,600
my mercy and I don't have any you're at
my nothing

593
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,070
spinny blade wall Machiavellian no well
good good

594
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:06,020
finally a nemesis worthy of my vast
intellect no wait come back up sorry

595
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,350
please no I was going I was going
somewhere with all that fool you were a

596
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:14,270
fool to come back because I've trapped
you again helpless you're at my mercy

597
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,560
and I don't have any
you're at my nothing you're at mine but

598
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,360
you're at my lack of mercy and again not
playing along you're ruining or are some

599
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,680
really good speeches actually didn't
even get to the good part yet twist
ending so twisty you might even call it

600
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:35,090
spinning don't ignore the laughter you
know what nothing to worry about the

601
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:42,380
puppet master you're a puppet in a play
and I hold all the strings and cards

602
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,520
still still got the card got the cards
in one hand and I got the strings in the

603
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,380
other hand and I'm making you dance like
a puppet playing cards

604
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,020
alright fine I'm not saying another word
till you do it properly I'm sick of this

605
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:01,100
Holmes versus Moriarty Aristotle versus
masse spiked plates stay still please

606
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,030
alright stop moving almost caught you
there I was going you there where'd you

607
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:09,830
go where'd you go come back come back
did something break back there oh all
did it kill you that would be amazing if

608
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:17,900
it killed you hello oh yes I know just a
brainwave I'll be back if you're still

609
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,350
alive I'm gonna be back don't die until
I get back ah there you are

610
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:25,550
great let me just get rid of this
catwalk there we go I wanted to talk to

611
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,870
you for a moment if I may I'll be honest
the death traps have been a bit of a
failure so far for both of us I think

612
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:39,110
you'll agree and you are getting very
close to my lair lair weird in that

613
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,980
first offset out loud sounds a bit it
sounds a bit ridiculous really but I can

614
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,330
assure you it is what is a proper lair
deadly lair and I just wanted to give

615
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,880
you the chance to kill yourself now
before you get to the lair you just jump

616
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,220
into that masher just there that's a
death trap or a death option for you
sounds crazy I know but hear me out hear

617
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,890
me out once you get to my lair death
will not be optional or it will be
mandatory no tricks no surprises just

618
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:12,090
you dying as a result of me killing you
in a very very gruesome way so boom

619
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:17,670
better offer here is just kill yourself
you know a lot of effort isn't walking

620
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,150
all the way to my deadly lair where
there's a perfectly serviceable death

621
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,870
option right there again not a death
trap not a death trap your death would

622
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,350
be entirely voluntary and very much
appreciated the masher does work I

623
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:32,100
should point out as well know we've had
a couple of problems in the past they

624
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,820
smash two deadly works and it will kill
you if that's one of your concerns about

625
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:40,140
not jumping in the master will kill you
straight away painless but it won't be
painless obviously but it will it will

626
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,450
mash you up
in summary walk all the way to certain
doom or give up now

627
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,180
honorably like a samurai save yourself a
trip it's a win-win for you
plus I have put a lot of effort in

628
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,930
getting this lair ready for you so it
would certainly teach me a lesson if you
simply died painlessly 20 feet from the

629
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,660
door I'd be furious I've got my just
desserts
no more than I deserve but teach why not

630
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,000
teach me a lesson by just jumping in the
old masher I tell you if I was having a

631
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,290
shitty possible odds this is the word
wanna go mashed with dignity that would

632
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,980
be the way I choose and here's the best
part there's a conveyor belt that will

633
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,150
convey you inconvenient comfort right
into the masher you would have to lift a

634
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,630
finger everything taken care of didn't
have to didn't have to do that look

635
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,830
anyway smoke enough take your time I'll
let you think about it and I don't want

636
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,750
to pressure you is it the Larry's at the
masher

637
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,230
alright you know what my opinion is
master I'm leaning towards master up to

638
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,990
you just gonna give you some time to
think okay I'll take that as a no then
fight well may the best man win fear may

639
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,040
the best sphere win swap that swap that
in much more clever books okay I'll take

640
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,750
that as a no then well well well
welcome to morning

641
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:55,410
let me just flag something up according
to the control panel light up there the

642
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,950
entire building is gonna self-destruct
in about six minutes I'm pretty sure

643
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,650
it's a problem with the light I think
the lights on the blink but just in case

644
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,520
it isn't I am actually gonna have to
kill you as discussed earlier so let's

645
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,130
call that three minutes and then a
minute break where we should leave

646
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,040
allegedly two minutes to figure out how
to shut down whatever is starting all

647
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,760
the fires so anyway that's the itinerary
also I took the liberty of watching the

648
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,810
tapes of you killing her and I'm not
gonna make the same mistakes four-part
plan is this one no portal surfaces to

649
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:27,540
start the neurotoxin immediately three
bomb-proof shields for me leading

650
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,050
directly onto number four bombs for
throwing at you do you know what this

651
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,950
plan is so good I'm gonna give you a
sporting chance and turn off the
neurotoxin I'm joking of course

652
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:41,820
goodbye where are you going don't run
don't run I tell you I should run the

653
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,930
harder you breathe the more neurotoxin
you inhale it's bloody clever this stuff
seriously it's devilish still running

654
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,530
alright looks tiring tell you what you
stop running and I'll stop bombing you

655
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,020
that seems fair
alright you didn't go for that I see you

656
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,339
I was like point to you but you still
are inhaling neurotoxin so point

657
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:03,480
deducted look out I'm right behind you
no of course I'm not no you saw through

658
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,970
that one as well
forty feet tall right in front of you

659
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,920
not my greatest ruse to be honest still
giant robot though look at that oh where

660
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,890
are you going
no we're not going anywhere alright got

661
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,390
you trapped like a little jump suited
rat oh did you bring a little portal gun

662
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:22,980
there's nothing to port long to err love
just ten pounds of dead weight about to

663
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,609
be 210 fatty you're just delaying the
inevitable

664
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:30,810
alright you cannot run from my bombs
forever well you can if I keep aiming

665
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:35,220
them poorly but I'll get better as we go
and you'll just get tired this would go

666
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,630
a lot faster if you'd stay still then
I've have time to fix the facility so

667
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,500
one of us at least would live there's no
need to be selfish love you're gonna die

668
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,640
I should congratulate you by the way I
didn't actually think you would make

669
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,119
such a worthy opponent what are you
supposed to be brain damaged or

670
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,800
something yeah brain damaged like a fox
remember when I first told you how to

671
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,930
find that little portal thing you love
so much
well I thought you died on the way if

672
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,119
I'm honest all the others did you didn't
think you were the first did you

673
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,020
hahaha no no
fifth no I like six perhaps it's best to

674
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,180
leave it to your imagination what
happened to the other five do you know

675
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,079
what I think we're well past the point
of tasteful restraint so I'll tell you

676
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,609
happened to them they died horrific ly
they all died horrific ly trying to get
to that portal device that you're

677
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:22,349
gripping in your meaty little fingers
there oh but you were different weren't

678
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:27,539
you you were such a good jumper
problem-solver Oh clever but ambitious

679
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,180
you see ambitious that's your Achilles
heel
mine's Oh Oh almost told you clever

680
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:39,569
clever girl again brain damaged like a
fox you we've had some times haven't we

681
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:43,710
like that time I jumped off my
management rail not sure if I died or

682
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:48,599
not when I did and all you had to do is
catch me and you didn't did you

683
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,799
oh you remember that I remember that I
remember that all the time and we could

684
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:56,579
have talked our way out of it except you
forgot to tell me that you'd murdered

685
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:01,140
her and that she needed you to live so
the only available event for her age
would be good old crushable Wheatley

686
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,200
yeah
little details that I remember easy

687
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,430
little tidbits you could have used to
save me from getting crushed if you'd

688
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,510
cared wish you didn't obviously and
still do not Oh remember the time I took

689
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:21,569
over the facility greatest moment of my
life but you just wanted to leave didn't
want to share my success well so you

690
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:27,420
know I would be happy for you if you
succeeded

691
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:34,829
apart from right now obviously am I
being too vague I despise you I love you

692
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:42,359
you arrogant smugly quiet awful jump
suited monster of a woman you and your
little potato friend this place would

693
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:55,349
have been a triumph if it wasn't for you
oh that's sounded real no that was

694
00:54:55,349 --> 00:55:00,150
actually an impression of you actually
because you just fell into my trap my

695
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:06,240
brilliant trap just then I wanted you to
trick me into bursting that pipe didn't
trick didn't trick me seemingly trick me

696
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:15,480
to give you false hope because that
leads to overconfidence and that leads

697
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,360
to mistakes fatal mistakes it's all part
of a plan

698
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:25,170
ah but haha i jus actually made my
actual first mistake by telling you my

699
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:30,300
plan just now ah it's me old Achilles
heel again and armed with that knowledge

700
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:36,600
I imagine you won't even use the
conversion gel ah fate are cruel
mistress that conversion gel has been

701
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:46,140
sitting in that pipe going stagnant for
year you probably get botulism toward
portaling through it like that and

702
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:55,290
you'll probably get ringworm and
athlete's foot and cholera or something

703
00:55:55,290 --> 00:56:00,090
horrible it's gonna be even worse than
if I just blown you up but it's not too

704
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:05,970
late to avoid all of that by simply not
using the gel just stop using that I
said it there you are I said it I gave

705
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,680
you it gave you a game away my plan but
I just I couldn't watch you hurt

706
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:17,550
yourself like this ah what what happened
what happened what why have you what you

707
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:22,560
pawned to me why is that hold on are the
bloody bombs are stuck on doesn't matter
I've reconfigured the shields

708
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:29,310
oh I said core you've pawed me who told
you to do that was it her it's just
making me stronger love it's a fool's

709
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:36,090
errand are you trying to weigh me down
do you think I'll fall out of the

710
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:41,850
ceiling well work I'm not just quite
brilliant I'm also quite strong biggest
muscle in my body my brain second

711
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:49,650
biggest my muscles so it's not gonna
work clearly did you plant virus in them

712
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:54,270
okay but it's not gonna work either or I
can I've got a firewall mate literally

713
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:57,570
actually that know that I look a rat
that there appears to literally be a

714
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:02,670
wall of fire around this place that's
quite it's alarming to say the least

715
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:08,070
in fact I've got to take a break for a
minute up a partial break during which

716
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:12,780
I'll stop the facility from exploding
wall still throwing bombs at you all

717
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:18,390
right then let's let's see vital
maintenance protocols wow there's a lot
of them should have looked into this

718
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:28,230
earlier well let's try this do them
they're enough maybe maybe it's a

719
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,940
password
ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

720
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:46,180
no okay ay-ay-ay-ay-ay done both of
these skip it skip ahead a B C D G H

721
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:52,460
bloody worked I hacked I hacked it
hacked it back probably hacked now then

722
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:58,100
let's see let's see what we got here
oh reactor core emergency heat venting

723
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,730
protocols that's the problem right there
isn't it emergency you don't wanna see

724
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:07,010
emergency flashing out here never good
that is it never good right delete and

725
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,870
delete underneath where's the under
leapin enough I told you not to put
these cores on me but you don't listen

726
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:19,820
do you quiet all the time
quietly not listening to a word I say

727
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:25,910
judging me silently the worst kind all I
wanted to do was make everything better
from me all you had to do was to solve a

728
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,730
couple of hundred simple tests for a few
years and you couldn't even let me have

729
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,310
that
could you nobody's going to space mate

730
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:42,230
and another thing you never caught me I
told you I could die falling off that

731
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:46,430
rail you didn't catch me didn't even try
oh it's all becoming clear to me now

732
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:51,860
find some Joop to break your cryo sleep
give him some sob story about escaping

733
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,490
to the surface squeeze him for
information on where to find a portal
gun then when he's but he's no more you

734
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,450
see you he has a little accident doesn't
he fools of his management rail doesn't

735
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,690
he here in this together aren't you
you've been playing me the whole time

736
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:09,320
both of you first you made me think
you're brain damage then you convinced

737
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,070
me your sworn enemies with your best
friend over here then then when I

738
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:17,090
reluctantly assume the responsibility of
running the place you conveniently

739
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:20,690
decide to run off together just what I
need you the most I'll bet there isn't

740
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,470
even a problem with the facility is
there I bet there's no such thing as a
reactor core okay that's not even fire

741
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,400
coming out of the walls is it
it's just cleverly placed lights and

742
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,960
papier-mache a parasol is all those
pieces of the ceiling that keep falling

743
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,910
out probably probably actual pieces of
the ceiling I bet they look real but

744
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,060
doesn't signify anything is my point but
the real point oh you know I just

745
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:48,560
remembered football
kicking a ball around for fun cruel

746
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:55,640
obviously humans love it now for shoulda
seen it coming you have been a thorn in

747
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:03,530
my side long enough oh I see
what do you think no no no no no no
